# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction-Model
This project builds a machine learning model to predict insurance claim risks using demographic and policy data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), evaluation, and deployment preparation.
Tools Used  
 **Python** – Programming language for development  
 **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing and manipulation  
 **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation  
 **XGBoost** – Advanced gradient boosting algorithm  
 **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
 **Joblib** – Saving and loading trained models  
Conclusion  
The project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end process of building a predictive model for insurance data. Data preprocessing and feature engineering significantly improved model performance, while ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost achieved strong predictive accuracy. This project highlights the role of machine learning in insurance analytics, helping businesses minimize risks and make informed decisions.
